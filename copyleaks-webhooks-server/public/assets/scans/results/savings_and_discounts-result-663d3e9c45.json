And thanks to a combination of the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) which covers 26 percent of your total solar panel cost, and net metering incentives, investor-owned utilities are mandated to purchase excess solar electricity from homeowners. This helps cut the cost over time and essentially helps homeowners use their stored solar electricity to pay off the cost of installing solar panels. If you're interested in moving into the future by offsetting soaring electricity prices with solar power solutions, you need to know about SunPower Solar.\nIs Solar Right For Me?\n\nUnSplashOutside of the rebates and incentives, do you dread opening your power bill each month?

With the right information, anyone can now afford to power their lives with solar panels. Because energy harvested from solar panels means independence from rising utility rates, they are one of the only home improvements that will pay for itself.\nWhy Choose SunPower Solar?\n\nUnSplashUnlike conventional systems, SunPower Solar designs and protects your entire solar-powered system from consultation to installation and beyond, so you're dealing with a single company that provides you with simple solutions and one overall warranty.
